# PythonOMPL_via_VREP
Simple integration between python 3 and OMPL in V-REP.

The motivation of the code here is to enable access to the OMPL demo 



To create a successful connection, you need the following files also in the same folder 
1. remoteApi.so
2. vrep.py
3. vrepConst.py

These files are found in the V-REP distribution you are currently using (see the V-REP) documentation.
